Data types: int, float, string
Values can be stored in variables: spam = 42


Exponent **

2 ** 3 = 8

Modulus/remainder %

22 % 8 = 6

Integer division/floored quotient //

22 // 8 = 2

Division / 

22 / 8 = 2.75

Multiplication * 

3 * 5 = 15

Subtraction - 

5 - 2 = 3

Addition + 

2 + 2 = 4


The expression evaluates down to a single, new string value that combines the text of the two strings. However, if you try to use the + operator on a string and an integer value, Python will not know how to handle this, and it will display an error message.

The input() function waits for the user to type some text on the keyboard and press ENTER.


The str(), int(), and float() functions will evaluate to the string, integer, and floating-point forms of the value you pass, respectively. Try converting some values in the interactive shell with these functions, and watch what happens.


For example, the input() function always returns a string, even if the user enters a number. Enter spam = input() into the interactive shell and enter 101 when it waits for your text.
